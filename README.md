# Renal Tumor Detection 

## Overview
Detecting renal tumors early is crucial for effective treatment. This repository focuses on the development of a machine learning model for Kidney Disease detection, specifically targeting renal tumors. Renal tumors can be either benign or cancerous, often remaining asymptomatic until discovered during diagnosis for unrelated conditions.

## Key Features
- **Early Detection:** Leverage machine learning algorithms to identify renal tumors in their early stages.
- **Accuracy:** Enhance accuracy in distinguishing between benign and cancerous tumors.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy integration into healthcare systems.
